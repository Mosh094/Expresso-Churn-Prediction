# Expresso-Churn-Prediction
Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each Expresso customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.  This solution will help Expresso to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving.
